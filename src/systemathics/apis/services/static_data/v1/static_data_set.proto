// Reference data encompasses a wide range of specification data about:
// <br>- financial instrument such as asset class, symbol, maturity, etc.
// <br>- counterparties such as issuer information.
// <br>- pricing such as open, high low and close prices.
// <br>- The challenge with reference data is that it tends to be sourced from multiple sources: internal, counterparties and providers.
// <br>- Reference data dedicated service is a result of various data sources and fields sourcing, validation, cross-checking and normalization.
